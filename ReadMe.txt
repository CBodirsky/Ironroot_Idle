Browser Factory Game
This is a lightweight prototype for a resource processing game inspired by Factorio.
There are currently no plans to flesh this game out further, but rather a display of proof of concept.

Core gameplay loop
1.) Gather raw materials (Mine iron and copper ore, stone, coal, etc)
2.) Refine the resources manually (Iron ore to iron ingots)
3.) Craft materials (iron ingot to iron gears)
4.) Use those materials for building automation (combining gears, wire, stone to make smelters, simple factories)
5.) Progress to making more advanced materials (stamping iron plates and making copper wire to make circuit boards, which is totally based on real circuit board production of course)
6.) Make further machines that can take two inputs and more.

Other than fleshing out the content, if I do expand this game I'll work on the UI being more interactive and decorative and perhaps sound effects
